# PoGo-IV-Renamer
This will use Python and ADB to view Pokemon's IV and rename them

Hello!
I was a post on Reddit that I finally had time to get around to. Someone wanted a new solution for automation of renaming of Pokemon on their Android devices.

There is probably a better solution out there but I thought this would be a fun challenge. 

I am sleep deprived as I have a 1 month old at home but hopefully this will be easy to use and helpful. 

DISCLAIMER. 
I like to program for fun and I also do not work for Nintendo or Niantic. I am not responsible if you get banned or the world ends. 

Feel free to contribute, I am no professional so I am probably making mistakes.
