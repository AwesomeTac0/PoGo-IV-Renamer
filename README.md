# PoGo-IV-Renamer
This will use Python and ADB to view Pokemon's IV and rename them

Hello!
I was a post on Reddit that I finally had time to get around to. Someone wanted a new solution for automation of renaming of Pokemon on their Android devices.

There is probably a better solution out there but I thought this would be a fun challenge. 

I am sleep deprived as I have a 1 month old at home but hopefully this will be easy to use and helpful. 

DISCLAIMER. 
I like to program for fun and I also do not work for Nintendo or Niantic. I am not responsible if you get banned or the world ends. 

Feel free to contribute, I am no professional so I am probably making mistakes.

# Requirements
You need to have ADB installed in your system PATH or place in the project folder. 
You will also need to install the requirement file. Open CMD/Terminal to the project folder and run: pip install -r requirements.txt

# Running
Currently it is setup to just display the IV if you have the IV screen open already. If you have it open to the first pokemon you want renamed, it will do the rest and cycle through the list. 
Just need to type python main.py while in the project folder.
